# GoReview Application 🍕

GoReview is a restaurant review website, which will help you make up your mind before you eat 😋

## Who we are

## Project Overview 

This collaborative project was completed as part of the Bright Network Technology Academy programme. We have built a React application that interacts with a Spring API. Main user features of our app:

Filter restaurants by cuisine
Select a restaurant to view all reviews and submit a new review
Add a new user using the “register” button

## Step-By-Step Instructions for Initial Setup 

1. Clone repository containing both the API and React App: 
``git clone git@github.com:joaopulsz/restaurant-review-website.git``
2. Create a database in terminal: 
``createdb go_review``
3. Run the Spring Boot API through your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ)
4. Launch the React application: 
``npm install
npm start``

## MVP:

Show all restaurants
Use routing to render a new page populated with reviews when user chooses a restaurant
Form to submit a new review which is automatically updated in the list of reviews
Register new user
Filter restaurants by cuisine

## Extensions: 

Order reviews reverse chronologically
Reformat review components to be capitalised

## Further Development

Add thumbs up icon for each review
Enable user to edit a review they posted
Allow user to attach image to review using <file> input type and show this on the review
Authentication

## Final Comments: 

The most challenging parts of our project were:

Kat => Removing value from state when checkbox is unticked
Sakusan => Getting new routes to render in a new page as opposed to within the current page
João => Keeping everything formatted and looking good across different screen sizes.

We would also like to acknowledge the BNTA team, and all the trainers for their amazing support during the program!
