## Project Overview 

This collaborative project was completed as part of the Bright Network Technology Academy programme. This project aimed to build a back end for a restaurant review website, it consisted of a User who would log on to the website, and then place a review on one of their most recently visited restaurants. 

In the review the user can create a new restaurant if the restaurant is not already in the database, other functionality included in the review section are:
- the user can also give a rating out of 5
- give a rating of the price of the restaurant 
- an optional message 
- can attach lables to the review including, different types of accesible features and  diet 

The API was created using Java, and Spring boot, as well as, using Postman for testing.

## Step-By-Step Instructions for Initial Setup 

1. Make sure that you have installed Java.
2. Clone this repository : `git clone git@github.com:VilteNor/GoReviewAPI.git` and open in you Java IDE
3. Create a database called `go_review`
4. If you don't already have it, download Postman so that you can interact with the API, the HTTP queries you will make will be on : `localhost:8081/(command inserted here)`

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP): 

For our MVP we wanted to create an app with CRUD funtionality with 3x classes:

- Users
- Restaurants 
- Reviews

## Extensions: 

For our extentions we wanted to add the following functionality: 

- get the average rating for each restaurant. 
- create a moderator class, where when the user completes a review it will enter a pending section and be later reviewed by the moderator. 
- don't let a user write a review to the same restaurant for at least 7 days.
- retrieve a list of restaurants by using an inputted enum. 
- retrieve a list of reviews by using an inputted enum. 

## Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs):

## Testing: 

The project was tested through postman. The application created is the HTTP client and many http requests were wriiten as a way to test if the expected reponces were recieved,
preventing bugs and improving performance.


Here is an example of an example test:

## Final Comments: 

If we were to add further implementations to the project, we would add:

-  more of our extentions, but were not able to due to time constraints
- authentication and security features to our website through spring security
- some J-unit tests, or have worked in TDD style manner.


We would also like to acknowledge the BNTA team, and all the trainers for their amazing support during the program!
